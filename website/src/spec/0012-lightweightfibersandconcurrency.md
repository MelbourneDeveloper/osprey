## 12. Lightweight Fibers and Concurrency

üöß **IMPLEMENTATION STATUS**: Fiber syntax is partially implemented. Basic fiber operations (`spawn`, `await`, `yield`) are in the grammar but runtime support is limited.

‚ùå **NOT IMPLEMENTED**: The fiber-isolated module system is a design goal but not yet implemented. Current module support is basic.

### 12.1 Fiber Types and Concurrency

Osprey provides lightweight concurrency through fiber types. Unlike traditional function-based approaches, fibers are proper type instances constructed using Osprey's standard type construction syntax.

#### Core Fiber Types

**`Fiber<T>`** - A lightweight concurrent computation that produces a value of type T
**`Channel<T>`** - A communication channel for passing values of type T between fibers

#### Fiber Construction

Fibers are created using standard type construction syntax:

```osprey
// Create a fiber that computes a value
let task = Fiber<Int> { 
    computation: fn() => calculatePrimes(n: 1000) 
}

// Create a fiber with more complex computation
let worker = Fiber<String> { 
    computation: fn() => {
        processData()
        "completed"
    }
}

// Create a parameterized fiber
let calculator = Fiber<Int> { 
    computation: fn() => multiply(x: 10, y: 20) 
}
```

#### Spawn Syntax Sugar

For convenience, Osprey provides `spawn` as syntax sugar for creating and immediately starting a fiber:

```osprey
// Using spawn (syntax sugar)
let result = spawn 42

// Equivalent to:
let fiber = Fiber<Int> { computation: fn() => 42 }
let result = fiber

// More complex spawn
let computation = spawn (x * 2 + y)

// Equivalent to:
let fiber = Fiber<Int> { computation: fn() => x * 2 + y }
let computation = fiber
```

The `spawn` keyword immediately evaluates the expression in a new fiber context, making it convenient for quick concurrent computations without the full type construction syntax.

#### Channel Construction

Channels are created using type construction syntax:

```osprey
// Unbuffered (synchronous) channel
let sync_channel = Channel<Int> { capacity: 0 }

// Buffered (asynchronous) channel  
let async_channel = Channel<String> { capacity: 10 }

// Large buffer channel
let buffer_channel = Channel<Int> { capacity: 100 }
```

#### Fiber Operations

Once created, fibers and channels are manipulated using functional operations:

**`await(fiber: Fiber<T>) -> T`** - Wait for fiber completion and get result
**`send(channel: Channel<T>, value: T) -> Result<Unit, ChannelError>`** - Send value to channel
**`recv(channel: Channel<T>) -> Result<T, ChannelError>`** - Receive value from channel
**`yield() -> Unit`** - Voluntarily yield control to scheduler

```osprey
// Create and await a fiber
let task = Fiber<Int> { computation: fn() => heavyComputation() }
let result = await(task)

// Channel communication
let ch = Channel<String> { capacity: 5 }
send(ch, "hello")
let message = recv(ch)

// Yielding control
yield()
```

#### Complete Fiber Example

```osprey
// Producer fiber
let producer = Fiber<Unit> {
    computation: fn() => {
        let ch = Channel<Int> { capacity: 3 }
        send(ch, 1)
        send(ch, 2) 
        send(ch, 3)
    }
}

// Consumer fiber
let consumer = Fiber<Unit> {
    computation: fn() => {
        let ch = Channel<Int> { capacity: 3 }
        let value1 = recv(ch)
        let value2 = recv(ch)
        let value3 = recv(ch)
        print("Received: ${value1}, ${value2}, ${value3}")
    }
}

// Start both fibers
await(producer)
await(consumer)
```

#### Select Expression for Channel Multiplexing

The `select` expression allows waiting on multiple channel operations:

```osprey
let ch1 = Channel<String> { capacity: 1 }
let ch2 = Channel<Int> { capacity: 1 }

let result = select {
    msg => recv(ch1) => process_string(msg)
    num => recv(ch2) => process_number(num)
    _ => timeout_handler()
}
```

#### Rust Interoperability

Osprey fibers are designed to interoperate with Rust's async/await system:

```osprey
// Osprey fiber that calls Rust async function
extern fn rust_async_task() -> Future<Int>

let osprey_task = Fiber<Int> {
    computation: fn() => await(rust_async_task())
}

let result = await(osprey_task)
```

## 12.2 Fiber-Isolated Module System

‚ùå **NOT IMPLEMENTED**: The fiber-isolated module system is a design goal but not yet implemented. Current module support is basic.

### Module Isolation Principles

The fiber-isolated module system eliminates data races by design through:

1. **Fiber-Local State**: Each fiber gets its own isolated copy of module state
2. **No Shared Mutable State**: Modules cannot share mutable data between fibers
3. **Immutable Sharing**: Only immutable data can be shared between fibers
4. **Automatic Isolation**: Module isolation happens automatically without explicit synchronization

### Module Declaration Syntax

```osprey
module ModuleName {
    // Module declarations
    let value = 42
    mut counter = 0
    
    fn increment() -> Int = {
        counter = counter + 1
        counter
    }
    
    fn getValue() -> Int = value
}
```

### Fiber Isolation Behavior

When a fiber accesses a module, it gets its own isolated instance:

```osprey
module Counter {
    mut count = 0
    
    fn increment() -> Int = {
        count = count + 1
        count
    }
    
    fn get() -> Int = count
}

// Each fiber gets its own Counter instance
let fiber1 = spawn Counter.increment()  // Returns 1
let fiber2 = spawn Counter.increment()  // Also returns 1 (separate instance)

let result1 = await(fiber1)  // 1
let result2 = await(fiber2)  // 1 (not 2!)
```

### Memory and Performance Characteristics

- **Copy-on-First-Access**: Module instances are copied when first accessed by a fiber
- **Memory Isolation**: Each fiber's module state is completely isolated
- **No Synchronization Overhead**: No locks, atomics, or other synchronization primitives needed
- **Deterministic Behavior**: Same input always produces same output within a fiber

### Inter-Fiber Communication

Since modules are isolated, inter-fiber communication must use explicit channels:

```osprey
module Database {
    mut connections = []
    
    fn connect() -> Connection = {
        // This connection is fiber-local
        let conn = createConnection()
        connections = conn :: connections
        conn
    }
}

// Fibers communicate via channels, not shared module state
let resultChannel = Channel<String> { capacity: 10 }

let worker1 = spawn {
    let conn = Database.connect()  // Fiber-local connection
    let result = query(conn, "SELECT * FROM users")
    send(resultChannel, result)
}

let worker2 = spawn {
    let conn = Database.connect()  // Different fiber-local connection  
    let result = query(conn, "SELECT * FROM products")
    send(resultChannel, result)
}
```

This design ensures that concurrent access to modules is always safe without requiring explicit synchronization.

## 12.3 Server Applications and Long-Running Processes

### 12.3.1 Functional Approaches to Server Persistence

**Osprey is a functional language and does NOT support imperative loop constructs.** Server applications that need to stay alive should use functional patterns instead:

#### 12.3.1.1 Fiber-Based Server Persistence

Use fibers to handle concurrent requests and keep the server process alive:

```osprey
// HTTP server with fiber-based request handling
fn handleRequest(requestId: Int) -> Int = {
    // Process the request
    let response = processData(requestId)
    response
}

fn serverMain() -> Unit = {
    let server = httpCreateServer(port: 8080, address: "0.0.0.0")
    
    // Spawn fibers to handle requests concurrently
    let requestHandler = spawn {
        // Use functional iteration to process incoming requests
        range(1, 1000000) |> forEach(handleRequest)
    }
    
    // Keep server alive by awaiting the handler fiber
    await(requestHandler)
}
```

#### 12.3.1.2 Recursive Function Patterns

Use tail-recursive functions for continuous processing:

```osprey
fn serverLoop(state: ServerState) -> Unit = match getNextRequest(state) {
    Some { request } => {
        let newState = processRequest(request, state)
        serverLoop(newState)  // Tail recursion keeps server alive
    }
    None => serverLoop(state)  // Continue waiting for requests
}

fn main() -> Unit = {
    let initialState = initializeServer()
    serverLoop(initialState)  // Functional "loop" via recursion
}
```

#### 12.3.1.3 Event-Driven Architecture with Channels

Use channels for event-driven server architectures:

```osprey
fn eventProcessor(eventChannel: Channel<Event>) -> Unit = {
    let event = recv(eventChannel)
    match event {
        Success { value } => {
            processEvent(value)
            eventProcessor(eventChannel)  // Continue processing
        }
        Error { _ } => eventProcessor(eventChannel)  // Retry on error
    }
}

fn serverWithEvents() -> Unit = {
    let eventChan = Channel<Event> { capacity: 100 }
    
    // Spawn event processor fiber
    let processor = spawn eventProcessor(eventChan)
    
    // Spawn request handlers that send events
    let handler1 = spawn handleHTTPRequests(eventChan)
    let handler2 = spawn handleWebSocketRequests(eventChan)
    
    // Wait for all handlers
    await(processor)
    await(handler1)
    await(handler2)
}
```

#### 12.3.1.4 Functional Iterator-Based Processing

Use functional iterators for continuous data processing:

```osprey
// Stream processing with functional iterators
fn processIncomingData() -> Unit = {
    // Process data in batches using functional approach
    range(1, Int.MAX_VALUE) 
    |> map(getBatch)
    |> filter(isValidBatch)
    |> forEach(processBatch)
}

fn webSocketServer() -> Unit = {
    let server = websocketCreateServer(port: 8080, address: "0.0.0.0", path: "/ws")
    
    // Use functional processing instead of loops
    let dataProcessor = spawn processIncomingData()
    let connectionHandler = spawn manageConnections(server)
    
    await(dataProcessor)
    await(connectionHandler)
}
```

### 12.3.2 Why No Imperative Loops?

**Functional Superiority:**
1. **Composability** - Functional iterators can be chained with `|>`
2. **Safety** - No mutable state, no infinite loop bugs
3. **Concurrency** - Fibers provide better parallelism than loops
4. **Testability** - Pure functions are easier to test than stateful loops

**Anti-Pattern:**
```osprey
// ‚ùå WRONG - Imperative loops (NOT SUPPORTED)
loop {
    let request = getRequest()
    processRequest(request)
}
```

**Functional Pattern:**
```osprey
// ‚úÖ CORRECT - Functional approach
fn serverHandler() -> Unit = {
    requestStream() 
    |> map(processRequest)
    |> forEach(sendResponse)
}
```

### 12.3.3 Performance Considerations

Functional approaches in Osprey are optimized for:
- **Tail call optimization** prevents stack overflow in recursive functions
- **Fiber scheduling** provides efficient concurrency without OS threads
- **Channel buffering** enables high-throughput event processing
- **Iterator fusion** optimizes chained functional operations

This functional approach provides better maintainability, testability, and performance than traditional imperative loops.
