# Osprey Programming Language

A modern functional programming oriented language designed for elegance, safety, and performance. It is written in Go and outputs to LLVM.

## Installation

```bash
# Add the tap
brew tap melbournedeveloper/osprey

# Install Osprey
brew install osprey
```

## Local Development Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/christianfindlay/vexels.git
cd vexels/compiler
make build
./bin/osprey examples/simple.osp
```

## Language Features

- **Functional-first**: Immutable data, pattern matching, pipe operators
- **Type-safe**: Algebraic data types with variant types
- **HTTP-native**: Built-in server/client with streaming support
- **Fiber concurrency**: Lightweight isolated execution contexts
- **Zero-cost abstractions**: Compiles to efficient LLVM IR

## Syntax Examples

```osprey
// Variables and functions
let x = 42
fn add(x, y) = x + y

// Types and pattern matching
type Result = Ok { value: Int } | Error { message: String }
let status = match result {
    Ok -> "success"
    Error -> "failed"
}

// HTTP server
httpServer(8080) |> onRequest((req) => 
    response(200, "Hello World")
)
```

## Development

Built on proven tech: [Go](https://golang.org/) for the compiler, [ANTLR](https://www.antlr.org/) for parsing, and [LLVM](https://llvm.org/) for code generation.

**The best part**: You don't need to be a compiler expert. AI agents like Claude Sonnet 4 with Cursor make implementing language features accessible to anyone willing to learn. That combo was the first that actually got me over the hump of building a compiler, though other AI setups could get you there too.

**Use VS Code Dev Containers** - strongly recommended. Open in VS Code and hit "Reopen in Container". Everything's pre-configured.

```bash
cd compiler
make install-deps  # Install Go dependencies
make build         # Build compiler
make test          # Run tests
make regenerate-parser  # Regenerate from grammar
```

## Status

ðŸš§ **Alpha**: Core language features implemented. HTTP and fiber systems in development.

See [compiler/spec.md](compiler/spec.md) for implementation status and roadmap.
