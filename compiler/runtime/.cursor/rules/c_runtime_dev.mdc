# C Runtime Development Rules

- **IDIOMATIC CODE** - Follow C conventions and best practices
- **EXPLICIT ERROR HANDLING** - Check all errors, return early on failures
- **MINIMAL C CODE** - bubble code up to Osprey that doesn't need to be written in C
- **DO NOT STOP UNTIL TESTS PASS** - Run make test
- **WRITE INTEGRATION TESTS FOR THE RUNTIME** - Osprey must depend on a RELIABLE, COMPLETE, but MINIMAL underlying runtime
- **PURE FUNCTIONS** - Avoid side effects where practical (except for performance)
- **DOCUMENT ALL EXPORTED FUNCTIONS** - All exported functions need documentation
- **STATIC ANALYSIS TOOLS** - Use strict static code analysis and don't ignore this
- **FOLLOW compilersbestpractice.md** - Adhere to project-specific compiler guidelines
