  Realistic Sample Project Recommendation

  üöÄ Task Management API with Real-time WebSocket Dashboard

  This project showcases Osprey's strongest features:

  Core Architecture:

  1. HTTP API Server - RESTful task management endpoints
  2. WebSocket Server - Real-time dashboard updates
  3. Concurrent Processing - Fiber-based request handling
  4. Type-Safe Effects - File I/O, logging, state management
  5. Pattern Matching - Request routing and validation

  API Endpoints:

  - GET /tasks - List all tasks
  - POST /tasks - Create new task
  - PUT /tasks/{id} - Update task status
  - DELETE /tasks/{id} - Delete task
  - GET /health - Health check

  Real-time Features:

  - WebSocket notifications for task changes
  - Live dashboard showing task status
  - Multi-user concurrent access

  Technology Showcase:

  - Algebraic Effects for file I/O and logging
  - Fiber Concurrency for handling multiple connections
  - Pattern Matching for request routing
  - HTTP/WebSocket Integration for full-stack capability
  - Type Safety with Result types for error handling

  This hits the sweet spot of:
  - ‚úÖ Realistic - Common business application
  - ‚úÖ Implementable - Uses Osprey's working features
  - ‚úÖ Impressive - Shows unique language strengths
  - ‚úÖ Educational - Demonstrates best practices
