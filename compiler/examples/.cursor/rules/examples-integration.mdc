# Examples Integration Rules

- **EXAMPLES ARE INTEGRATION TESTS** - They prove compiler works with real, runnable code
- **TESTED EXAMPLES PRIMARY** - Examples in `tested/` folders with expected outputs
- **CONSOLIDATE BY FUNCTIONALITY** - Group related examples, avoid many tiny files
- **MEATY EXAMPLES** - Demonstrate substantial functionality, not trivial "hello world"
- **INCLUDE EXPECTED OUTPUTS** - All examples need corresponding expected output files
- **SHOW REAL-WORLD PATTERNS** - Mirror how developers will use the compiler
- **ORGANIZE BY FEATURE** - Separate fiber, http, websox into distinct folders
- **FAILSCOMPILATION EXAMPLES** - Demonstrate proper compiler error handling
- **MINIMIZE PRINT STATEMENTS** - Only include prints for debugging or demonstration
- **COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE** - Each example should thoroughly demonstrate target functionality
