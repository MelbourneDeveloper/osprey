# Examples Integration Rules

- **EXAMPLES ARE INTEGRATION TESTS** - They prove compiler works with real, runnable code
- **NEVER DISABLE OR DELETE EXAMPLES** - The only exception is when consolidating examples into one file
- **TESTED EXAMPLES PRIMARY** - Examples in `tested/` folders with expected outputs
- **INCLUDE EXPECTED OUTPUTS** - All examples need corresponding expected output files
- **CONSOLIDATE BY FUNCTIONALITY** - Group related examples, avoid many tiny files
- **MEATY EXAMPLES** - Demonstrate substantial functionality, not trivial "hello world"
- **SHOW REAL-WORLD PATTERNS** - Mirror how developers will use the compiler
- **ORGANIZE BY FEATURE** - Separate fiber, http, websox into distinct folders
- **FAILSCOMPILATION EXAMPLES** - Demonstrate proper compiler error handling
- **MIX IT UP** - Don't aim for isolation. Mix functionality together
- **MINIMIZE PRINT STATEMENTS** - Only include prints to prove the functionality is working or demonstration
- **COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE** - Each example should thoroughly demonstrate target functionality
