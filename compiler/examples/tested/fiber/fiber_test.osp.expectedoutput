=== Fiber Test ===
Computing Fibonacci numbers in parallel...
Fib(10) = 55
Fib(15) = 610

Producer/Consumer pattern:
Producer 1 created: Success(307)
Producer 2 created: Success(607)
Producer 3 created: Success(907)

Cooperative multitasking with yield:
Task 1 progress: 25%
Task 2 progress: 50%
Task 3 progress: 75%
All tasks complete: 100%

Select returned priority value: 1000
