=== Fiber Module Isolation Test ===

Test 1: Concurrent execution order test:
Task 3 result: 300
Task 1 result: 100
Task 2 result: 200

Test 2: Channel communication test:
Consumer 1: 15
Consumer 2: 25
Consumer 3: 35

Test 3: Yield behavior test:
Yield sequence: 10, 20, 30

Test 4: Complex fiber interactions:

Test 4: Module access from different fibers:
Fiber 1 got: 1000
Fiber 2 got: 2000
Fiber 3 got: 3000
Transform 1: 142
Transform 2: 242

=== CONCURRENCY VERIFICATION ===
✅ Multiple fibers can be spawned
✅ Await can happen in any order
✅ Yield returns control values
✅ Module functions accessible from fibers
⚠️  NOTE: True concurrency requires runtime support!
