=== Fiber Module Isolation Test ===

Test 1: Concurrent execution order test:
Task 3 result: 300
Task 1 result: 100
Task 2 result: 200

Test 2: Channel communication test:
Consumer 1: Success(15)
Consumer 2: Success(25)
Consumer 3: Success(35)

Test 3: Yield behavior test:
Yield sequence: 10, 20, 30

Test 4: Complex fiber interactions:

Test 4: Module access from different fibers:
Fiber 1 got: Success(1000)
Fiber 2 got: Success(2000)
Fiber 3 got: Success(3000)
Transform 1: Success(142)
Transform 2: Success(242)

=== CONCURRENCY VERIFICATION ===
✅ Multiple fibers can be spawned
✅ Await can happen in any order
✅ Yield returns control values
✅ Module functions accessible from fibers
⚠️  NOTE: True concurrency requires runtime support!
