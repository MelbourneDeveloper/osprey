# Spec Rules

- NO DUPLICATION. always search before adding text, consolidate where appropriate
- Keep it tight. remove flowery language that doesn't assert how the syntax works 
- Keep it udpated. When functionality is not implemented, mark it as such and correct spec examples when they don't match the TESTED examples.  
- LESS CURLY BRACES, SEMICOLONS and BRACKETS. - more ML style
- Keep it ordered: check the numbering and fix when needed
- Always take the best practices document into account. Follow the URLS in the document for more information when making decisions 
- Check all examples are actual Osprey syntax unless the functionality has not been implemented yet. Fix they are wrong.
