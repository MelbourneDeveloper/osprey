- CONSISTENCY! - the language has drifted in a few different directions but we need to bring it back to a consistent style with FEWER curly braces and semicolons. More ML style
- Elegance -> Safety -> Performance in that order of priority
- Avoid visual noise
- Keep it concise
- Avoid obscure operator characters
