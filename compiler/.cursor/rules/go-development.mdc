# Go Development Rules

- **ALWAYS RUN make clean & make build * make test AFTER MAKING CHANGES** You are not finished until this passes 
- **PREFER FUNCTIONS OVER METHODS** - Use functions unless receiver state is needed
- **EXPLICIT ERROR HANDLING** - Check all errors, return early on failures
- **DO NOT STOP UNTIL TESTS PASS** - Run make test
- **PURE FUNCTIONS** - Avoid side effects where practical (except for compiler performance)
- **USE TYPE SWITCHES** - Pattern match on interface{} types instead of casting
- **TABLE-DRIVEN TESTS** - Organize multiple test cases efficiently
- **GODOC COMMENTS** - All exported functions need documentation starting with function name
- **IDIOMATIC GO CODE** - Follow Go conventions and best practices
- **STATIC ANALYSIS TOOLS** - Run make lint
- **FOLLOW compilersbestpractice.md** - Adhere to project-specific compiler guidelines
