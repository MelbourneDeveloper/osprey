# Unit Testing Rules (Problem Isolation Only)

## When to Write Unit Tests

**WRITE UNIT TESTS FOR CONFIDENCE** - only test functions where it's unclear if they work correctly.

**FOCUS ON PURE FUNCTIONS** - these are predictable and easy to test in isolation.

**TEST HIGH-LEVEL FUNCTIONALITY** - prove functionality without calling lower levels of the code.

---

## Unit Test Specific Guidance

**REMOVE LOW-VALUE UNIT TESTS** - delete tests that don't prove much, especially when covered by integration tests.

**DON'T TEST MESSY MUTABLE STATE** - use integration tests to verify complex stateful interactions.

**DON'T DUPLICATE INTEGRATION TEST COVERAGE** - if an integration test already covers it, skip the unit test.

**Remember: Most functionality should be tested through integration tests. Unit tests are for specific problem isolation.**
