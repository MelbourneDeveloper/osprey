# Production API Rules

- **SECURITY FIRST** - We don't want this thing running up a huge bill so check every line for DOS attacks
- **MUST RETURN TWO OUTPUTS OR ERROR OUTPUT** - The main API returns 1. Compiler output 2. App output, and these must be distinct in the JSON response
- **KEEP DOCKERFILE IN SYNC WITH DEV CONTAINER DOCKERFILE** including dependency versions
- **PRODUCTION API** - Don't break it, keep changes minimal and safe
- **SERVES LSP FOR WEBSITE** - This API must stay working for language server
- **DOCKER COMPOSE MUST WORK** - Build and run successfully for deployment
- **API ENDPOINTS MUST RESPOND** - Ensure all endpoints return proper responses
- **HANDLE ERRORS PROPERLY** - Don't let the API crash, fail gracefully
- **INTEGRATION TESTS ARE KEY** - Docker Compose pipeline tests are critical
- **DON'T BREAK THE PIPELINE** - If CI tests fail, fix immediately
- **KEEP IT SIMPLE** - Don't over-engineer this basic project
- **MAKE IT DEPLOYABLE** - Ensure app deploys to host without issues
