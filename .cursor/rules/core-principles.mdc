# Core Development Principles

- **NEVER DUPLICATE CODE** - Edit in place, never create new versions
- **KEEP ALL FILES UNDER 500 LOC** - Break large files into focused modules  
- **NO PLACEHOLDERS** - Fix existing placeholders or fail with error
- **NEVER IGNORE TESTS** - Don't reduce assertions to make tests pass, fail loudly
- **NEVER COMMIT/PUSH** unless explicitly requested
- **FOLLOW STATIC ANALYSIS** - Pay attention to linters and fix issues
- **MOVE FILES, DON'T COPY** - Use CLI commands to move files
- **NO SWEARING IN CODE** - Keep code professional
- **USE CONSTANTS** - Name values meaningfully instead of using literals
- **SEARCH BEFORE ADDING** - Check for existing code before creating new functions/constants
