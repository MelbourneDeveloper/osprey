# Documentation Comments

Default `///` comments and ML `(** ... *)` comments lower to the same
structured documentation model. Equivalent comment bodies therefore have the
same representation after flavor lowering ([FLAVOR-BOUNDARY]).

Compiler and language rules are separate from integration tooling. See [Documentation tools](../tooling/DocumentationTools.md) for the extracted contract.

## Shared model `[DOC-MODEL]`

`DocComment` stores:

- a one-line `summary` from the first paragraph and the remaining Markdown in
  `body`;
- ordered parameter, error, example, and related-link entries;
- optional return, version, deprecation, and author text; and
- the comment scope.

`DocExample` stores the Osprey source, optional expected output, and whether the
example is runnable. Both syntax flavors use this model.

## Default sigil `[DOC-SIGIL-DEFAULT]`

In Default files, consecutive `///` lines document the declaration that
follows. The marker and one optional following space are removed. A blank
`///` line separates paragraphs.

```osprey
/// Doubles its argument.
fn double(x) = x * 2
```

Ordinary `//` comments do not produce documentation.

## ML sigil `[DOC-SIGIL-ML]`

In ML files, `(** ... *)` documents the declaration that follows.

```osprey-ml
(** Doubles its argument. *)
double x = x * 2
```

ML block comments nest. `(**` starts documentation only when content follows
the opener; `(**)` and all-star banners such as `(*****)` remain ordinary
comments. An unterminated documentation comment is a syntax error.

Each prose line drops its leading whitespace and one optional `*` continuation marker. A line inside a fenced code block drops only the margin its opening fence carried, so an example keeps the indentation ML layout depends on.

## Inner sigil `[DOC-SIGIL-INNER]`

`//!` documents the scope that encloses it rather than the declaration that
follows. It is spelled the same in both flavors: only the outer sigil differs.
Consecutive `//!` lines form one comment, and the marker plus one optional
following space is removed from each.

A `//!` block is legal as the first item of a file, of a `namespace` brace body,
or of a `module` body, and it lowers to that scope's own documentation. A
file-scoped `namespace name;` header opens no body, so the file's `//!` documents
the file.

```osprey
//! Payment primitives shared by the billing modules.

/// Converts cents to a display string.
fn format(cents) = "${cents}"
```

An outer and an inner comment describe the same scope from opposite sides, so a
scope may carry both at once and neither replaces the other.

```osprey
/// What callers need to know about the module.
module Ledger {
    //! What a maintainer reading the body needs to know.
    export let entries = []
}
```

`//!` written anywhere else documents nothing and is rejected. It is never
treated as an ordinary `//` comment: a discarded documentation comment is
indistinguishable from one that was never written. Nor is any of it read as
code — the text after the marker is comment text wherever the marker sits. Both
flavors reject it with the same error at the position of the `//!`, naming the
flavor's own outer sigil as the alternative: `` `//!` documents the enclosing
file, namespace or module; write it as the first item of one, or use `///` to
document the declaration that follows `` (`(** … *)` in ML).

## Body markup `[DOC-BODY-MARKDOWN]`

The stripped body is Markdown in both flavors and passes through one parser.
The first paragraph becomes a whitespace-normalized summary. Text after the
first blank line becomes the body, except for recognized sections and aliases
described below.

### Symbol links `[DOC-LINK]`

`[Name]` and dotted `[Owner.member]` forms are symbol links. Standard Markdown
links such as `[text](https://example.com)` are not symbol links. In LSP hover,
hovering a symbol link shows the referenced declaration; a dotted link resolves
to its owner declaration.

## Recognized sections `[DOC-SECTIONS]`

The following case-insensitive level-one headings populate structured fields:

| Heading | Field | Content |
|---|---|---|
| `# Parameters` / `# Params` | `params` | `- name: description` bullets |
| `# Returns` / `# Return` | `returns` | prose |
| `# Raises` / `# Errors` | `raises` | `- name: description` bullets |
| `# Examples` / `# Example` | `examples` | Osprey and output fences |
| `# See also` / `# See` | `see_also` | comma- or line-separated entries |
| `# Since` | `since` | prose |
| `# Deprecated` | `deprecated` | prose |

The aliases `@param`, `@return`, `@returns`, `@raise`, `@raises`, `@throws`,
`@see`, `@since`, `@deprecated`, and `@author` populate the same fields.
Unrecognized Markdown remains text in its current region.

## Declaration attachment `[DOC-ATTACH]`

An outer documentation comment attaches to the following declaration. Both
flavors attach docs to functions, `let`/`mut` bindings, types, effects, externs,
modules, and signatures, including declarations inside modules. Only these
declaration forms receive a documentation field.

An inner comment attaches instead to the scope containing it — the file, a
namespace, or a module ([DOC-SIGIL-INNER]) — and is recorded separately from
that scope's outer comment.

Docs do not attach separately to variants, fields, or parameters. A parameter
is documented in its function's `# Parameters` section, and hovering the
parameter shows that entry ([LSP-HOVER-PARAM-DOCS](../tooling/0020-LanguageServerAndEditors.md)).

### Effect operations `[DOC-EFFECT-OP]`

An effect operation is the one nested form that carries its own documentation.
A `///` (Default) or `(** … *)` (ML) block written directly above an operation
line attaches to that operation, and both flavors lower it to the same
`EffectOperation::doc`. An operation documents ITSELF: the owning effect's doc
describes the capability as a whole and serves only as a fallback for an
undocumented operation. Without per-operation docs, sibling operations hovered
identically and said nothing about the operation under the cursor
([LSP-HOVER-EFFECT-OPERATIONS]).

The operation's recorded position anchors on its NAME, not on its declaration
node, so a leading doc block does not drag the position up onto the comment and
defeat position-based hover resolution.
